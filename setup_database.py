- Check Physical Connection: Ensure the thin green fiber optic cable is securely plugged into the back of your router and into the wall socket. It should "click" into place.
- Inspect the Cable: Look for any sharp bends, cuts, or damage along the length of the fiber cable. The cable is delicate and can be easily damaged.
- Reboot Your Router: Turn off the power to your router, wait for 30 seconds, and then turn it back on. Wait for 2-3 minutes for the lights to stabilize.
- Contact Support: If the 'LOS' light is still red after these steps, it signifies an issue with the external fiber line in your area. Please use the Airtel Thanks App to raise a service request or call our customer care for assistance. A field engineer will need to investigate.$$

            $$Slow data speeds can be caused by several factors. Here are a few quick things you can try:
- Toggle Airplane Mode: The simplest fix is often to turn Airplane Mode on for 10 seconds and then turn it off. This forces your phone to reconnect to the nearest cell tower.
- Restart Your Phone: A simple restart can resolve many temporary network glitches.
- Check for Local Outages: Use the Airtel Thanks App to check if there are any reported network outages or maintenance activities in your specific area.
- Reset Network Settings: If the problem persists, you can try resetting your phone's network settings.
On iPhone: Go to Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Reset > Reset Network Settings.
On Android: Go to Settings > System > Reset options > Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth.
Note: This will erase your saved Wi-Fi passwords, so you will need to re-enter them.
If none of these steps work, please contact customer support.$$

            'I can send text messages (SMS), but I am not receiving any.',
            $$This issue is usually related to your device settings or SIM card. Please try the following:
- Check Phone Storage: If your phone's internal memory or inbox is full, it can prevent new messages from being received. Delete old messages and files to free up space.
- Review Block List: Make sure you haven't accidentally blocked the numbers you are expecting messages from. Check your phone's call and message blocking settings.
- Restart Your Device: Turn your phone off and on again. This can often solve the problem.
- Re-insert SIM Card: Power off your phone, carefully remove the SIM card, wipe it with a soft, dry cloth, and re-insert it correctly. Power your phone back on.
- Check in Another Phone: If possible, insert your SIM card into a different phone. If you start receiving messages on the other phone, the issue is with your device settings. If you still don't receive messages, the problem might be with your SIM or our network service provisioning. In this case, please contact customer care.$$
